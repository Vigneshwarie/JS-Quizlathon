# JS-Quizlathon

## Description

This webpage was created to demonstrate the knowledge gained in the Advanced Javascript week in coding boot camp and as a part of the class assignment submission. The Quizlathon page was developed using HTML, CSS, and JS technology. The online quiz application starts when the user clicks on the start button. Once started, the user will have 30 seconds to complete the challenge. New questions will be auto-populated as soon as the user answers the question, and the application will show whether the selected option is correct. If the user selects a wrong answer, the timer will be reduced by 5 seconds. On test completion, the user will be prompted for a name, and the score will be populated on submission.
